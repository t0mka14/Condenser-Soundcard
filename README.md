# Condenser-Soundcard
High gain USB soundcard with 5V power for headset condenser microphones.
This repo contains Kicad design files for a USB soundcard using PCM2912. It is basically a catalogue schematic, with the exception that there is a voltage pump to step up the DC bias voltage to 5V. We use this soundcard in our team at FEE CTU to record patients with various neurodegenerative diseases (https://sami.fel.cvut.cz/). I also include stl files with a box for the soundcard. Below you can find some graphs of parameters which I measured:
